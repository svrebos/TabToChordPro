[Intro]

Am     Em


[Verse]

      Am
I was perched outside in the pouring rain
Em
Trying to make myself a sail
          G
Then I'll float to you my darlin'
         D7
With the evening on my tail
                 Am
Although not the most honest means of travel
   Em
It gets me there nonetheless
      G
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
      D7
And a helpless one at best


[Chorus]

             Am
Darling I'll bathe your skin
          Em
I'll even wash your clothes
             G                   D7
Just give me some candy, before I go
                 Am
Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes
                 Em
And lay you down on your rug
             G
Just give me some candy
        D7
After my heart


[Verse]

      Am
Oh I'm often found explaining
Em
But to her it plays out all the same
          G
and although I'm left defeated
         D7
It get's held against my name
                 Am
I know you got plenty to offer baby
   Em
But I guess I've taken quite enough
      G
Well I'm some stain there on your bedsheet
      D7
You're my diamond in the rough


[Chorus]

             Am
Darling I'll bathe your skin
          Em
I'll even wash your clothes
             G                   D7
Just give me some candy, before I go
                 Am
Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes
                 Em
And lay you down on your rug
             G
Just give me some candy
        D7
After my heart


[Instrumental]

Am Em G D7
Am Em


[Chorus]

  G                             D7
I know that thereÂ´re writings on the wall
                Am
But Darling I'll bathe your skin
          Em
I'll even wash your clothes
  G
Just give me some candy
        D7
After my heart


[Outro]

C                      G
I'll be there waiting for you
C                      Em
Oh I'll be there waiting for you
C                      G
I'll be there waiting for you
C                   Em
I'll be there waiting for you
C                    G
I'll be there waiting for you
C                    Em
I'll be there waiting for you
C                    G
Oh I'll be there waiting for you
C                    Em
I'll be there waiting for you
C
All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
G
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
C
All the cheap and their sugary philosophies
G
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
C
All the angels and their halos
G
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
C
All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
G
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
C
All the cheap and their sugary philosophies
G
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
C
All the angels and their halos
G
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
